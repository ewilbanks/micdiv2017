Authored by Lizzy Wilbanks for Swarthmore College BIOL133, Spring 2017


## Today's tutorial will introduce you to a few important topics, including HOW TO:
- Transfer files between your AWS EC2 instance and your laptop using `scp`
- Download publicly-hosted data to an EC2 instance using `wget`  
- Explain how to launch an EC2 instance based on a community amazon machine image (AMI)
- Use Jupyter notebooks to follow tutorials or take kickass computational notes
- Start using QIIME, the major software pipeline for analyzing high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequence data

###1. Launching a community AMI
This section of the tutorial will exaplin how you can launch an EC2 instance that's got all the software we need preinstalled.
